### Results (brain regions)
Four-layered multilayer network using the following brain regions:

1. Frontal Pole (FP)
2. Superior Temporal Gyrus (STG)
3. Parahippocampal Gyrus (PHG)
4. Inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)

All the results are obtained using the query set of genes in PHG region. Gene rankings are given in the files using the following nomenclature:

AD_ranking_FP_query_set_in_PHG.csv -> Gene ranking in FP region using a multilayer network constructed using AD data from AD population.

### Query genes
These gene rankings are obtained using synaptic genes as the query set. We analyse these results in our manuscript. 

We considered another query set - PIG (plaque-induced genes) and the analysis is reported in the supplementary text. The gene rankings along with the query set of genes is given in the subdirectory "Results with PIG query genes."
