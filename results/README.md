### Results
This folder contains the centrality scores and ranking of genes obtained using multilayer centrality method.
For each hormone, we provide the gene rankings in the source (producing) as well as the target (responding) tissues.

For example: In case of Insulin hormone, Pancreas act as the source tissue and we consider Liver as the target tissue.

insulin_producing_gene_rankings.csv -> ranking of genes in Pancreas tissue (considering the query set in Liver).
insulin_responding_gene_rankings.csv -> ranking of genes in Liver tissue (considering the query set in Pancreas)
